# Top K Frequent Elements

## Problem Statement

Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.

## Examples

Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: Since 1 and 2 are the two most frequent elements.

## Constraints

- You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
- Time complexity should be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.
